Hereâ€™s a Python project idea that uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and connects to a **SQL Server** database to run queries. This project will simulate a simple **Employee Management System**.

---

### **Project: Employee Management System**

#### **Features:**
1. Connect to a SQL Server database.
2. Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an `Employees` table.
3. Use OOP principles to structure the code.

---

### **Steps to Implement:**

#### 1. **Set Up SQL Server Database**
- Create a database named `CompanyDB`.
- Create a table named `Employees` with the following columns:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
      FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
      LastName NVARCHAR(50),
      Email NVARCHAR(100),
      Department NVARCHAR(50),
      Salary DECIMAL(18, 2)
  );
  ```

---

#### 2. **Install Required Libraries**
Install the `pyodbc` library to connect to SQL Server:
```bash
pip install pyodbc
```

---

#### 3. **Python Code**

```python
import pyodbc

# Database connection class
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, server, database, username, password):
        self.server = server
        self.database = database
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.connection = self._connect()

    def _connect(self):
        try:
            conn = pyodbc.connect(
                f"DRIVER={{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}};"
                f"SERVER={self.server};"
                f"DATABASE={self.database};"
                f"UID={self.username};"
                f"PWD={self.password}"
            )
            print("Connected to SQL Server successfully!")
            return conn
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error connecting to SQL Server: {e}")
            return None

    def close(self):
        if self.connection:
            self.connection.close()
            print("Connection closed.")

# Employee class to handle employee operations
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.db_connection = db_connection

    def create_employee(self, first_name, last_name, email, department, salary):
        query = """
        INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Email, Department, Salary)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        """
        cursor = self.db_connection.connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query, (first_name, last_name, email, department, salary))
        self.db_connection.connection.commit()
        print("Employee created successfully!")

    def get_all_employees(self):
        query = "SELECT * FROM Employees"
        cursor = self.db_connection.connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query)
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
        for row in rows:
            print(row)

    def update_employee(self, employee_id, department, salary):
        query = """
        UPDATE Employees
        SET Department = ?, Salary = ?
        WHERE EmployeeID = ?
        """
        cursor = self.db_connection.connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query, (department, salary, employee_id))
        self.db_connection.connection.commit()
        print("Employee updated successfully!")

    def delete_employee(self, employee_id):
        query = "DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = ?"
        cursor = self.db_connection.connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query, (employee_id,))
        self.db_connection.connection.commit()
        print("Employee deleted successfully!")

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Database credentials
    server = "your_server_name"
    database = "CompanyDB"
    username = "your_username"
    password = "your_password"

    # Create database connection
    db = DatabaseConnection(server, database, username, password)

    if db.connection:
        # Create Employee object
        emp = Employee(db)

        # Create a new employee
        emp.create_employee("John", "Doe", "john.doe@example.com", "IT", 50000.00)

        # Get all employees
        print("\nAll Employees:")
        emp.get_all_employees()

        # Update an employee
        emp.update_employee(1, "HR", 55000.00)

        # Delete an employee
        emp.delete_employee(1)

        # Close the database connection
        db.close()
```

### **How It Works:**
1. **DatabaseConnection Class**: Handles the connection to the SQL Server database.
2. **Employee Class**: Encapsulates methods for CRUD operations on the `Employees` table.
3. **Main Program**: Demonstrates how to use the classes to interact with the database.

---

### **How to Run:**
1. Replace `your_server_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your SQL Server credentials.
2. Run the script, and it will perform the following:
   - Create a new employee.
   - Fetch and display all employees.
   - Update an employee's department and salary.
   - Delete an employee.

---

### **Extensions:**
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
- Add a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Extend the system to manage other entities like departments or projects.
